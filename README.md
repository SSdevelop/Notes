# Notes

In this repository I will mostly push my notes for different topics in STEM.
The notes will be made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
Each folder is a seperate vault.

In order to view the notes:
1. Install Obsidian from https://obsidian.md/
2. Open the required folder using **Open Vault** option in Obsidian.
